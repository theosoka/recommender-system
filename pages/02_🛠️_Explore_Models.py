    By definition, **Singular Value Decomposition**(more often called SVD) is a *generalisation of the eigen-decomposition

It is a powerful matrix factorization technique commonly used in recommender systems to uncover underlying factors and 
patterns in user-item interaction data. This has proven effective in improving recommendation accuracy and providing 
personalised recommendations. SVD was a major breakthrough in the Netflix movie recommendation
 system that went by the name Netflix Prize. This method allows to have initial data in a compressed way, preserving 
 all information, but taking significantly less space.
