        binary classifiers. A binary classifier is a function which can decide whether or not an input, represented 
        by a vector of numbers, belongs to some specific class. It is a type of linear classifier, 
        i.e. a classification algorithm that makes its predictions based on a linear predictor function combining a 
        set of weights with the feature vector."""
